# AI Space Explorer

AI Space Explorer is a project that utilizes Generative AI and Natural Language Processing techniques to answer questions related to space and quantum mechanics. It provides users with informative responses generated by a pre-trained language model.

## Features

- Query-based responses on space-related questions.
- Integration of a custom dataset for more context-aware responses.
- Easy-to-use interface for interacting with the AI model.

## Dataset

The project includes a dataset (`qa.csv`) containing questions and answers related to space. This dataset enhances the AI model's responses by providing additional context.

### Dataset Structure

The dataset is structured as follows:

- **Question**: The question about space or quantum mechanics.
- **Answer**: The corresponding answer to the question.
