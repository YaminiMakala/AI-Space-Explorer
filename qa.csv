Question,Answer
What is the uncertainty principle?,The uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that the more precisely the position of a particle is known, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.
What is quantum entanglement?,Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where the quantum states of two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when separated by large distances.
What is a black hole?,A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It is formed when a massive star collapses under its own gravity at the end of its life cycle.
What is the theory of relativity?,The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, consists of two main parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity describes the relationship between space and time in the absence of gravity, while general relativity extends this to include the effects of gravity.
What is dark matter?,Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter that is thought to make up approximately 27% of the total mass-energy content of the universe. It does not emit, absorb, or reflect light, which makes it invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects on visible matter.
What is quantum gravity?,Quantum gravity is a theoretical framework that attempts to describe the force of gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics. It aims to reconcile the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity on large scales, with the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe the behavior of particles on small scales.
What is the Big Bang theory?,The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model that describes the early development of the universe. It proposes that the universe originated from a hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since.
